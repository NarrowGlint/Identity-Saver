# Python

I made these games in python!
Enjoy!
If you copy, please give me some credit!

Information for specific games:

AI Rock Paper Scissors (.py):
- I did not program the computer to always win! The computer uses txt files to remember which option the player chose then best choose the player next time.
- To reset the game, click the reset.py script(This sets the AI values back to 0)

Tic Tac Toe (.py):
- Just a fun game I created thats not the greatest

MusicDownloader (.py and .exe):
- I programmed this using selenium web testing modules for python.
- It is useful for overnight downloading since it does bring up a visible browser.
